output: html_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This article shows you how to cite papers with three or more authors using *et al.* style. The example is for jpe bib style, but the method should apply to other citation styles as well.

- Step 1: before `\begin{document}`, add ```\immediate\write18{cp `kpsewhich jpe.bst` .}``` (the space before `.` cannot be missing) to tell the shell to copy the "jpe.bst" file to your Overleaf project.
- Step 2: To the right of the **Recompile** button, you can find **Logs and output files**, click on this button and go to the bottom right, from **Other logs and files**, find "jpe.bst", click to download.
- Step 3: rename the downloaded file to "myjpe" and upload it to your Overleaf project.
- Step 4: open the "myjpe.bst" file on Overleaf and find `FUNCTION {format.lab.names}`, under this section, change `numnames #3 > and` to `numnames #2 > and`, that is, for papers with number of authors names over 2 (3 or more), use "et al." style.
- Step 5: change the `\bibliographystyle{jpe}` to `\bibliographystyle{myjpe}`.
- Step 6: recompile.

<p><strong>Teleworkability: the Weakened Tie between Workplace and
Residential Place</strong></p>
<p>Abstract: Since the industrial revolution, workplaces and residential
areas have been closely linked, a pattern sustained by economic and
urban development strategies. However, advancements in information
technology and the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the shift to
telework, reducing the need for physical presence at the workplace. This
paper examines the impact of telework on migration patterns and
home-work distances using data from the American Community Survey
(2017-2022). Employing a difference-in-differences approach, it analyzes
how teleworkability influences migration likelihood and distance,
utilizing the COVID-19 pandemic as an exogenous shock. Jobs are
classified as teleworkable based on Dingel and Neimen (2020).
Preliminary results show that teleworkable workers are more likely to
migrate and over longer distances. The overall migration rate for
teleworkable workers increased by 10%, with a 15% rise in cross-state
migration and a 5.5% increase in migration distance. Teleworkable
workers also experience a 6% increase in one-way work travel time and a
7% higher likelihood of working across different areas. This study
underscores the profound implications of telework for lifestyle choices
and broader economic and urban structures, offering insights for
policymakers and urban planners.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education Expansion and Intergenerational
Mobility</strong></p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tentatively proposes a human capital investment
model to analyze how higher education expansion has changed education
attainment of children. The model assumes altruistic parents who invest
in children’s schooling and non-schooling activities. Schooling
investment has an upper limit while non-schooling investment does not.
When higher education expansion takes place, meaning that participation
rate of higher education is raised and the probability of being admitted
to colleges increases, parents would adjust their investment behavior to
maximize dynastic utility. Model implies that education expansion is not
necessarily associated with an improvement in intergenerational mobility
since rich families having more resources would invest more in
non-schooling activities when schooling investment is constrained. Using
data from 2010 Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to estimate the
effects of the expansion on intergenerational mobility (IGM), results
show an improvement in IGM using child’s overall education attainment as
the measure but no significant increase in child’s probability of being
admitted to higher education institutions. Further study indicates that
richer and higher-educated families spend more in child’s
extracurricular activities as education expansion happens.</p>

**Are Businesses Doing Business in China? with Ruochen Dai, Shuo Liu, Xiaobo Zhang**

How many firms shown in the Business Registration Database are doing business in the economy? According to our estimation, nearly 40 percent of registered firms in China are probably not. We define these companies as inactive firms. Seemingly harmless, inactive firms may have a great impact on the economy. Shell companies, lowering the operating cost of some companies through financial maneuvers, could potentially squeeze out other businesses. Closed firms may affect the economy from the policy side. Firm registration database is widely used to measure productive activity and gauge the size of entrepreneurship, which are crucial for both economic analysis and policy making. The extensive existence of inactive firms could bias the policy decision and thus affect the economy as a whole.

Given the importance of inactive firms, the studies on this topic are scarce in large due to lack of data. In this paper, based on the primarily collected Enterprise Survey for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in China (ESIEC) data and the administrative annual enterprise report data, we successfully label the business status of a representative sample of all registered companies in China. Then, we construct an ensemble learning model, the Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) to detect the inactive companies. Results show that for all existed firms in administrative record in 2018, around 40 percent are inactive. The share of inactive firms varies across industries and locations. Inactive firms concentrate in Liaoning and Henan province and comprise a smaller fraction in Zhejiang province. They also concentrate in high-subsidy industries such as agriculture, and value-added tax reform industries such as transportation, finance, and business service industries. Using public data, we construct an XGBoost model to predict the inactive status of companies. XGBoost behaves well in spotting inactive firms, with a precision rate being 0.71 and sensitivity rate being 0.65.

Quality of a Match</a>, with Michele Belot and Vaios
Triantafyllou</strong></p>
<p><em>Labour Economics</em>, 2024</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of an employment match is a central concept in
labor economics. It is relevant for evaluating the welfare impact of
labor market policies, and for our understanding of labor market
dynamics. This paper reviews the challenges associated with measuring
match quality. We first review measures commonly used in the literature,
their advantages, and drawbacks. We then present novel evidence from a
survey sample of US employees where alternative measures were collected
simultaneously. We show that while some of these measures correlate
well, others do not. Finally, we present additional partial evidence on
the correlations between measures based on the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY79), a substantially larger and nationally
representative survey. The takeaway message is a word of caution
regarding the interpretation of some of these measures and specific
concerns regarding using wages and tenure as indicators of match
quality.</p>

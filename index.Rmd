## Hello!
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at Cornell University. I received my M.A. in economics from Peking University in 2019 and my B.A. in Project Management with a minor in Finance from Central University of Finance and Economics in 2015.

My research tries to understand what non-monetary attributes workers value at work and how they affect worker's behavior. My current research studies how teleworkability would affect worker's residential decision and labor market behaviors. I also try to use NLP methods to study what workers like and dislike at work.

You can find my CV [here](files/Curriculum Vitae-Xiaoying Liu-0123.pdf).
